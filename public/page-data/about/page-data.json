I love designing architectural structures and websites amongst other things. \nI attended Microverse, an online coding school, to master every aspect of skills a professional programmer should have, from technical skills ( Ruby on Rails, React, Javascript, HTML/CSS) to soft skills (Pair programming, Remote Working, Mentoring). Where I also worked part-time as a Technical Support Engineer and volunteered as a mentor.\nI am also an experienced Technology Program Facilitator at Kuva Africa, a nonprofit focused on igniting and enhancing leadership entrepreneurship skills and providing diverse platforms and opportunities for young girls in STEAM.\n\nI have a demonstrated history of working in Civic & Social Engagement Organizations and have proven myself to be a Leader, since when I was President of Association des Filles des Travaux Public (AFENSTP). I was able to inspire and motivate over 300 girls in engineering, encouraging them to find a balance in life between being a woman and an engineer.\nBeing an activist and an advocate for the girl child in STEAM, and contributing to the 5th SDG, I have organized and led 10+ outreach programs in the past 2 years for young girls in my community.\n\nI have a Master's degree in Structural Civil Engineering from Public Works Yaounde, Cameroon. \n\nCommitment and consistency are some of the values pulling me through my career as a young girl in STEM. Problem-solving, critical thinking, effective communication, and teamwork are my greatest strengths.","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/17f9b8b4ebd5238ebc16b8aa341a3683/46604/b99eae7511e6bce1e9de3c7b93937293.png","srcSet":"/static/17f9b8b4ebd5238ebc16b8aa341a3683/69585/b99eae7511e6bce1e9de3c7b93937293.png 200w,\n/static/17f9b8b4ebd5238ebc16b8aa341a3683/497c6/b99eae7511e6bce1e9de3c7b93937293.png 400w,\n/static/17f9b8b4ebd5238ebc16b8aa341a3683/46604/b99eae7511e6bce1e9de3c7b93937293.png 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
