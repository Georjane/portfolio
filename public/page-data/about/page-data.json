I love designing architectural structures and websites amongst other things. \nI attended Microverse, an online coding school, to master every aspect of skills a professional programmer should have, from technical skills ( Ruby on Rails, React, Javascript, HTML/CSS) to soft skills (Pair programming, Remote Working, Mentoring). Where I also worked part-time as a Technical Support Engineer and volunteered as a mentor.\nI am also an experienced Technology Program Facilitator at Kuva Africa, a nonprofit focused on igniting and enhancing leadership entrepreneurship skills and providing diverse platforms and opportunities for young girls in STEAM.\n\nI have a demonstrated history of working in Civic & Social Engagement Organizations and have proven myself to be a Leader, since when I was President of Association des Filles des Travaux Public (AFENSTP). I was able to inspire and motivate over 300 girls in engineering, encouraging them to find a balance in life between being a woman and an engineer.\nBeing an activist and an advocate for the girl child in STEAM, and contributing to the 5th SDG, I have organized and led 10+ outreach programs in the past 2 years for young girls in my community.\n\nI have a Master's degree in Structural Civil Engineering from Public Works Yaounde, Cameroon. \n\nCommitment and consistency are some of the values pulling me through my career as a young girl in STEM. Problem-solving, critical thinking, effective communication, and teamwork are my greatest strengths.","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/17f9b8b4ebd5238ebc16b8aa341a3683/46604/b99eae7511e6bce1e9de3c7b93937293.png","srcSet":"/static/17f9b8b4ebd5238ebc16b8aa341a3683/69585/b99eae7511e6bce1e9de3c7b93937293.png 200w,\n/static/17f9b8b4ebd5238ebc16b8aa341a3683/497c6/b99eae7511e6bce1e9de3c7b93937293.png 400w,\n/static/17f9b8b4ebd5238ebc16b8aa341a3683/46604/b99eae7511e6bce1e9de3c7b93937293.png 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
